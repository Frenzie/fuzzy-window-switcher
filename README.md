# Fuzzy Window Switcher

A fuzzy window switcher for Ubuntu (GTK based, so should work in other distros too, but I haven't tested). It shows you a list of open windows and uses a very simple regex based algorithm to sort them according to your input. Pressing enter opens the window at the very top.

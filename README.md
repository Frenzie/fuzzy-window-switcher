# Fuzzy Window Switcher

A fuzzy window switcher for Ubuntu (GTK based, so should work in other distros too, but I haven't tested). It shows you a list of open windows and uses Python's difflib to sort them according to your input. Pressing enter opens the window at the very top.

Development is still going on. I still have to add in hotkeys and tray icons, and maybe a better algorithm for sorting. Also, the interface has to improve. This was primarily inspired by Sublime Text's `Ctrl+P`.
